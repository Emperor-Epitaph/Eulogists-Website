			<h2 class="">About us</h2>
			<img class="about-band-image" src="/logo2.png" />
			<p>
			  The Eulogists is a combined effort between 5 musicians. Many of whom run
			  personal YouTube Channels. They wanted to combine forces to make
			  something great. The Eulogist Channel was born. We all wanted to be like
			  the big YouTube video essay channels. Channels such as Nexpo, Barely
			  Sociable, and blameitonjorge, but with a musical twist. They all had
			  this goal. But individually they could not make it happen. However, when
			  we made a joint effort, we could be more.
			</p>
			<p>
			  They all for the most part met on Discord through a technology server.
			  Even though they were on a technology server they started talking about
			  their musical interests. The idea was born. At first, they wanted to do
			  a podcast discussing music. However, that idea morphed into an entire
			  YouTube channel. It was just Calvin, Quinn, and Rylan at first. All
			  three from different countries, using Discord to chat. After their first
			  2 video essays, they knew they needed more people. It was then they
			  added Fifo.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Fifo was a wild card in our group. He did many things. Things like help
			  moderate the Eulogists discord. They all had their place in the group
			  contributing equally to help keep the YouTube channel running smoothly.
			</p>
			<p>
			  After they had decided to stick to a weekly upload schedule, they knew
			  that they had to have weekly filler content to fill the gaps between
			  essays. This is where Tusk comes in. Tusk’s expertise is in music mixing
			  mashups and remixes. He helped to provide. The filler that they needed.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Now, who was going to beef up the Discord and help to shape this awesome
			  website? None other than Mr Prosser. He is a Discord extraordinaire. He
			  helped program almost every bot you see on the Discord today. He was
			  also the leading force behind this website. Even though he is not an
			  official Eulogist he is still a major part of our little world on
			  YouTube.
			</p>
			<p>
			  After a little while, Tusk decided to leave and go on his own musical
			  endeavors. The Eulogists kept an eye out for someone sharp, with musical
			  talent, and that had time to work on music. A little bit after Tusk left,
			  Taliyah joined the discord. She fit the bill perfectly, and was able to do 
			  what they asked of her. Taliyah is a major part of composing music for The Eulogists.
			</p>
			<p>
			  The Goal of The Eulogists project is to teach and entertain. We want to
			  teach you about music and how it affects us human beings and builds our
			  world that we live in. We want to entertain you with our mashups and
			  remixes to keep you coming back and keep you engaged. Even though we
			  have a small channel we strive to have the highest quality content. On
			  behalf of everyone at The Eulogists, Welcome to our world.
